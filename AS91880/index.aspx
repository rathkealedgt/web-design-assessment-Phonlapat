        <h2>Planet</h2>
            <p> A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesima The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion.
            <p>Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet">Planet</a>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite.
            <p>Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year.During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a>
            <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
            <p>Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
            <p>Roughly three quarters of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sun's</a> mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
